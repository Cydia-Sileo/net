  "shortDescription": "Lately with the last couple Jailbreak versions ( Yalu and Electra mostly ) i decided to test out something new and probably needed: Apple Blocking!! This will include anti-revokes, blocking OTA updates, and more! . [[there is a huge inconvenience with OTA software updates, if the download has been found on your device, it will remain in the .xml file until the device is restored as new or changing boolan in plist value - a tutorial can be found on jailbreak sub reddit ]]. This works on wifi and cellular!",
