Perfect for ruining your sleep & figuring out someone is trying to break into your car resulting in having to pay a $500 deductible to your insurance company...because someone fucked with something you earned with your hard earned money. Fuck thieves, buy your own shit or get educated & find a better job. Also skrew people who don't recycle. Betches.",
