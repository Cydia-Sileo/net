  "shortDescription": "INSTALL XZ Utils from repo.bingner.com or electrarepo64.coolstar.org before installing!!!! GNU Debugger 7.10.50 for iOS with arm64 support. arm64 support added by swigger on Github, built and being fixed by @hackedbyshmoo. I need all the help I can get in fixing bugs. If you find a bug, or see any debug output, *PLEASE* DM me on Twitter @hackedbyshmoo with steps to reproduce so I can add that bug to my list. All arm64 devices are supported! If you are jailbroken with DoubleH3lix, this may not work due to problems of sending SIGINT (ctrl c) over SSH. See changelog at http://shmoo419.github.io/gdbchangelog.html",
