  "shortDescription": "The Game Boy Advance revolutionized the handheld gaming industry. For the first time, it was possible to have a video game console with the power of a Super Nintendo in your pocket. However, before the Game Boy Advance was ever released, Nintendo had launched two extraordinarily successful devices into the portable game console market: the Game Boy and the Game Boy Color. An amazing feature of the Game Boy Advance was its backwards-compatibility with these previous portable console games, and now GBA4iOS is doing the same. No longer do you have to find a separate emulator to play these old games; if it's a Game Boy anything game, GBA4iOS has you covered.",
