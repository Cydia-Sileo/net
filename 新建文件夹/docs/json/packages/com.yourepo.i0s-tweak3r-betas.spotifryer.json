  "shortDescription": "A really old Flex patch I made to customize Spotify. Too many aspects to go into detail, but basically this version puts regular Spotify on a frying pan and the “new” UI is result. Older versions of Spotify have more visible changes, but eventually will separate options, for current app version. Sorry no on/off button yet. Promise toads colorpickers and a pref bundle soon though.",
