  "shortDescription": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Vinculum is heavily inspired by the new Google Nexus 7.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nougat app drawer. A simple swipe up on the dock and you have access&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;to all of your installed applications. You can hold down on any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;application on the SpringBoard and hide it immediately, no respring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;required. You can even hide/unhide any application from within the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;settings as well. Vinculum is highly configurable and super easy to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
