  "shortDescription": "KeePass, an open source password manager, for jailbroken iPhones. KeePass is a free open source password manager, which helps you to manage your passwords in a secure way. You can put all your passwords in one database, which is locked with one master key. So you only have to remember one single master password to unlock the whole database. The databases are encrypted using the best and most secure encryption algorithms currently known (AES and Twofish). Note: JBiKeePass is not distributed or supported by the author of the Apple app store application iKeePass. Install your .kdb files into /var/mobile/Documents on the iPhone via whatever file transfer method you wish and they will appear in the open dialog.",
